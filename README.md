# 🦾 AI Engineer Project - Autonomous Agent
 
### **Project Overview**
This repository is the central brain of my autonomous agent. Using **n8n** and **advanced AI models (o3/gpt-4o)**, I am building a system that manages my learning path and automates professional tasks.
 
### **Mission & Vision**
* **Goal:** Become an expert AI & Automation Engineer.
* **Motivation:** To provide a better life for my parents (95 years old), my children, and my family. 
* **Roots:** From a humble "casa de tablitas" in Colombia to building a tech empire.
 
### **Technical Architecture (Virtuous Agent)**
* **Gateway Core:** Centralized control for all automations.
* **Proactive Heartbeat:** The agent "wakes up" every 30 minutes to check goals and tasks.
* **Markdown Memory:** Persistent context storage for continuous learning.
* **Reasoning:** High-effort planning using OpenAI o3 models.
